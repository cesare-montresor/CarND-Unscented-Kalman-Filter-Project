# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

This project implement an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

# Current solution
The current solution have been developed using xcode 8.3.3 and tested with the term2 simulator provided, the reported RMSE vs Dataset 1 is 0.07 0.08 0.34 0.22   

The code is fairely organized, modular and it appears to run smoothly, basic optimization have been put in place.
